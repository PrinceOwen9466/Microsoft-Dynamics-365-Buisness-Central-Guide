                Filtering out items based on their property has been made quite trivial by business central. 
                
                &lt;br/&gt;
                &lt;br/&gt;For example: If we were trying to find stock items that have been completely exhausted 
                from our company’s inventory (just like we’re doing in this walkthrough), we would simply type in ‘0’ into the textbox.
